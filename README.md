## OverView
In this project, we're going to create a computer keyboard.
Day 4 of Advent of JavaScript by Amy Dutton

**Users should be able to:**

- See the computer keyboard centered on the page
- A random letter will start to jiggle.
- The user should type the same key that's jiggling and it will stop.
- A new, random key will start jiggling

## My Process
I created an array of objects with all key elements and made a for loop to iterate through it to see which letter is moving.

## What I Learned
I learned about how to include the keyboard in webpages as well as how to tell the differnece from left and right of same keys.
